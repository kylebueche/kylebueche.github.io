## Introduction

I don't like the allowance of AI for assignments. I think it's dumb, especially for programming assignments. Widely accessible Artificial Intelligences are wonderful for grouping information together that might otherwise be scattered across multiple sources and forums. However, for the use of assignments, it is far more compelling to use AI to do the task for you, rather than assist your understanding of the problem and available solutions.

## Personal Experience with AI

In ICS 314, the class that I'm writing this paper for, I have not once felt as though AI could help improve my understanding, but I have considered using it for the large amount of tedious work that the class assigns. I've used AI once for this class, during a WOD when I was running out of time.

### Experience WODs

In the Experience WODs, I think that the use of AI would be really silly. I'd compare it to entering your house through the back door. Sure, you get in the house eventually, but the front door was right there. I have not used AI for any Experience WODs because all the information I need is provided in the assignment page, give or take outdated screncasts. Even in the case of outdated information, there is usually an answer already found or just a question away in our class Discord server.

### In-class Practice WODs

I did not use AI for the In-class Practice WODs, however I can see how they can be useful for the WODs that we do, which usually involve Meteor and React. These tools have funny little quirks like needing to put all images in a specific directory for them to import properly. AI would have been useful in explaining the "Why did my application start crashing when I imported an image?" question I've definitely had.

### In-class WODs

I have only used AI once in this class, and it was for an In-class WOD. I can't remember if it was useful but I do think it helped me navigate Meteor and React better.

### Essays

I think I trust AI to write my essay as much as I might trust my friends or family members to write my essays. That is, they might have the spirit to help, but in the end they don't know what *I* have to say on the topic. None of them can know what it is that *I* bring the the conversation. If we write essays to be read, people are going to read them only because they want to know what *I* have to say. If I don't actually care who wants to read my essay (i.e., just writing it for a grade), then I might resort to AI, but so far I haven't.

### Final project

I think if I built this habit I would never be able to keep a job. Coding projects require a lot of researching skills to find what fits your needs, and AI can generally give you those answers, but Google already makes it easy enough to find what you need faster, *most* of the time. I can see AI as being useful for debugging, especially with lazy error throwing from someone elses code.

### Learning a concept / tutorial

Learning online often requires learning from multiple sources, because source A has 90% of the info, but source B has 5% of the info you didn't get, and theres just that one thing they didn't cover that you're still stuck on. AI is amazing for meshing these sources together and providing more information in specific areas if it didn't cover everything you need the first time.

### Answering a question in class or in Discord

This seems silly. The person asking the question could've easily asked AI themselves, or perhaps they already have. But they chose not to because they want information that's not from AI. If someone asked me a question, I would try my best to answer it from my own abilities and resources.

### Asking or answering a smart-question

Asking a question in class or in Discord just feels like less work for me than asking AI, and it's likely to be much more helpful and reliable.

### Coding example

I've never used AI for this, but I would be skeptical about coode written by AIs like ChatGPT which predict the most likely word to come next when generating responses. Programming is logic expressed in words, and AI will probably get the syntax right, but could switch out an x = 1; for an x = 2; somewhere. ChatGPT has definitely swithed out numbers on me during calculations.

### Explaining code

This is like writing essays, why is anyone asking me if they don't want to hear my words? Going through another person to use AI is sillier than using AI.

### Writing code

Honestly why even bother programming. Whatever ChatGPT spits out for a given coding problem is going to confuse you because it lacks commentary on the reasons the program was designed that way. If you don't understand the code, you can't change it or use it very easily, and what even is the point of getting foundational programming knowledge in college. ChatGPT may be okay if you have a really good understanding and just need something to work with quick.

### Documenting code

Just write comments and a readme file, come on. If you can't explain what your code is doing, do you know what you're trying to code?

### Quality assurance

I personally would want to assure quality myself, rather than having an AI say "Yeah that seems pretty quality."

### Other uses in ICS 314 not listed

If I don't have a specific reason to use AI over just using Google, I don't see the point.

## Impact on Learning and Understanding

AI has helped me learn random things that I'm curious about, like what happened to the remaining Aztec people after the Spanish conquered them? It turns out that much of Aztec culture was foundational for Mexican culture. Things like Dia De Los Muertos, even the wide use of beans, corn, and chilies were all from the Aztec people. ChatGPT gave me a pretty good summary, but for things I want to dive deep in to learn and understand, I would not use AI.

## Practical Applications

ChatGPT is probably not going to fix my toaster. Ill stick with YouTube tutorials.

## Challenges and Opportunities

Resources that people have written or otherwise documented have always been better for my personal challenges than AI.

## Comparative Analysis

I personally haven't used AI to compare two different options, but it could be an interesting use of AI especially for software design choices at a company.

## Future Considerations

AI assistance and reasoning tools are pretty neat, and I'd like to see how they can be built for specific scenarios rather than the broad scope of data on the internet.

## Conclusion

AI is pretty dumb. I've felt like this class gives too much work within a week sometimes, to the point where it seems to be built with AI assistance in mind. If that is the case, it just makes things harder for people who don't want to use AI for their own personal reasons. I think that AI should be left as a tool that people can access if they choose to. It shouldn't be incorporated into a class that people are paying to learn in.
