#### The Good:
Over the last few days, my course in Software Engineering I has required the use of Bootstrap 5 in the replication of the graphical aspects of several websites. As i sit here recovering from those experiences, I'm trying very very hard to think of something I like about Bootstrap. I did enjoy the free icons, and row/col layouts, but I feel that relying on those things may limit what I can do with HTML. I don't enjoy Bootstrap, but I feel like that may change once I'm more comfortable with basic HTML and CSS.

#### The Bad and the Ugly:
Doing WODs with Bootstrap feels like one of those tests in highschool where you're graded on how much content you can memorize. It doesn't feel productive, it doesn't feel like I'm building skills that I'll use in the future. It feels like a punishment to me, although that is not what my professor nor the designer of the course intended. Rote memorization is just not my thing.

#### The Takeaway:
Bootstrap is probably very useful for people with lots of experience with HTML and CSS. I feel like I'm still a novice in both, and so I don't think I'm able to reap the benefits and time savings that Bootstrap provides. If I could change the Software Engineering I curriculum at all, I would love to keep building on pure HTML and build comfortability in that before trying out Bootstrap. One way to do this would be a more ambitious HTML project, but spread out over a longer period of time. The current curriculum consists of many many fast-paced mini-assignments. I feel that replacing many small assignments with one bigger assignment would heighten my skills and help to build confidence in them, which would help me to appreciate the time that Bootstrap can save.
