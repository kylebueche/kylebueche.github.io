As I am currently in my third semester of college, I have lots of room to explore my major and venture into specific areas. That being said, I'm already working towards my goal of attaining the Creative Computational Media Certificate. I am currently taking Introduction to 3D Animation, as well as AR/VR Development, two required courses in the CCM Certificate program. I took Discrete Mathematics II over the summer, which has allowed me to get a bit of a headstart by taking Software Engineering I alongside Program Structure this semester. You might be able to tell by now, but I really want to try out game development.

Besides being a required course, I hope that software engineering can point me in a good direction when it comes to game development. One thing I hate about games on the market is how badly optimized they tend to be, even from well known game development companies. This is something I really strive to change, at least in my little corner of the world. I don't want to work for a big company, and I'd much rather work by myself or in a group that is passionate about the experience that they're putting forth for users to enjoy.

In Insomniac's 'Spider-Man Remastered,' There are many many improvements to the swinging and fighting experiences that I would love to address. The main issue lies in the vast amount of cases that developers need to write code for and animate. I would love to explore an application of AI to this exact problem. I think that an AI-assisted physics engine could learn to interact with the environment and swing and fight much more realistically. For the record, I thought about this idea before I saw that one video on youtube talking about the exact same thing. I'm still very early in my major, so I've got a little headstart on these things, but I've also got a long way to go. I have lots to learn and explore, and that's exactly what I'm going to do.
