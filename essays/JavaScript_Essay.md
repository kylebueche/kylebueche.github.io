Of all the programming languages I've come to know, JavaScript reminds me of Python the most. I began my coding journey with Python in middle school, but that was a time before I understood how and why code actually works. After a long break from middle school to college, I forgot everything about Python and was introduced to Java.

As you might know, Java has a lot of rules, so my scope of what code could do became very limited by safeguards. My next language in university brought me back to python. Python was freeing. The realization that I could do without type safety and exceptions was very appealing to me. I loved that I could be responsible for my own mistakes and not have my hand held.

I'm currently learning Software Engineering and Program Structure at my university. Software engineering introduced me to JavaScript. Program structure introduced me to C. JavaScript is not like Java in some really important ways. It just feels more free to me and I love it so much more than Java. It reminds me of Python in that way. I would argue that C shares these qualities, but you get so much freedom that you bear a massive weight of responsibility.
