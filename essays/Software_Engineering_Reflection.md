#### A Reflection on Software Engineering I

Software Engineering I at UH Manoa is not the class I expected from the title of the course. The course centers heavily around web development through React JS and Meteor Mongo. While the class does cover certain concepts in software engineering, I feel as though I would prefer the experience from developing desktop applications. Although the Meteor React template we used for assignments was easy to download and change for our needs, I'm not going to build a career off a recycled template. I might be slightly biased, but I've heard a lot of negativity towards developers who exclusively use React on the internet, and I definitely don't want to confine myself to a premade React template if I ever step into web development. I will also hopefully never step into web development.

My favorite takeaway from this course was the experience I gained using Github. Throughout the course, I was taught how to to store code online, isolate potentially breaking changes in branches, and manage collaboration on a connected codebase in a simple way. I still don't know what black magic goes on under the hood of Github, (when you switch branches, files magically change, appear, and disappear in the project folder to match that branch) but whatever it is I like it. We also set up a basic portfolio through Github using a template, which is where you're reading this essay from.

One of my least favorite takeaways from this course was the exclusive use of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for any and all code throughout the course. Before taking this course, and still now, I have a mental association between JavaScript and web development. Why? I'm not really sure. Maybe it's because web browsers support it natively? That may or may not be true, but I would have liked to learn why JavaScript is at the core of so many web applications, because I do not like coding in JavaScript and would rather avoid it. I would have loved to develop desktop applications in C, especially to avoid bloatware.

Another one of my least favorite parts of this course is IntelliJ Idea. I despise this IDE with a passion. I think that there is so much bloat to it that just doesn't feel right. This is one of the reasons that I'm going to be making my own IDE in C. It's just going to be a simple file manager GUI next to a file editor panel, and maybe a terminal at the bottom, but I feel like that's all I really need for any project. I also don't like ESLint dictating how I code. And I really don't like NPM. Every time I use a software with like a hundred dependencies and I have to do an NPM install and it pops up with some scary messages that the teacher says to ignore. It just feels bloated and unsafe. I don't like software that constantly requires updates, or that depends on software like that. If software serves its purpose as is, stop making me update it every 5 days.

One goal of this class was to expose students to functional programming. After this class, I can safely say that I don't like it. It feels like theres this constant goal of abstraction to where you're doing "this.that.dothis.swapthat()" and then it looks super clean, but then your output for that line depends on 4 functions, and you have to keep that in mind if you have to change any of those functions. I also heavily dislike the "(param) => (function definition)" syntax. I feel like the point of a different syntax system should be the readability of code. This syntax on its own is alright, but when I start seeing it passed into another function ("somelist.map(x => (x.y, x.z))"), this code is not immediately clear to me. I personally find the classic "type function_name(params) { function definition, return statement }" syntax much more clear. Because this syntax doesn't leave any information out, anyone reading my code should understand what my function is trying to do at a glance.

All in all, this class was definitely an experience. If I didn't want to do web development before, I definitely don't want to now. I'm glad I was able to learn Github and set up a portfolio through it, but I really don't like JavaScript, IntelliJ Idea and all that. I'm going to keep exploring what I can do with lower level languages in the meantime, and I'll definitely be uploading that mini IDE to Github when I finish it.
