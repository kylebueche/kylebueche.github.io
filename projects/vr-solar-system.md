### The Project

<hr>

This was the final project for my AR/VR Programming class. I was on a team with two 3D artists, so I did the code. I designed an interactible solar system, with planets spinning at accurate rates relative to their orbit paths.

<br>

You can walk around the scene, grab planets, throw them around, and watch them collide. Planets stop spinning when you grab them, letting you take a closer look at them.

### Future VR

<hr>

The experience is super immersive, and a ton of fun to play around in. A vast-space environment is definitely on I want to revisit in future VR projects.
