### Augmented Reality

<hr>

I used Unity to create an interactable 3D Rubik's Cube, and I used an Augmented Reality library to map it to a real cube with printed patterns on it.

<br>

The cube is fully functional and solveable. You rotate the whole cube physically in the real world, and rotate the sides by swiping on your camera.
